# log-sanitizing-engine

# Agenda 
To enable a log sanitizing system that replaces sensitive data with a masked information. There are lot of tools existing for this, but they all depend on a pattern/structured data like IP/PWD/Telephone number and all. This engine, aims to provide masking for text's which adher to no patterns, like our greedytext.
